      It’s not a word used lightly these days. But over the last 75 years, Rico Industries has earned an unparalleled reputation for trust and integrity among its customers, vendors, and industry peers.
    </p>

    <p class="linejump">
      Founded in May 1944 by three immigrant relatives, Rico Industries began manufacturing wallets from scrap leather. The second generation continued this tradition of hard work and excellent service as Rico became the top supplier of private label wallets to various major retailers in the U.S.A. Its reputation as a vendor led those customers to ask Rico to distribute other
      companies’ products, including many sports licensees – which Rico had also become in 1984 – continuing as the third generation began to operate the family business.
    </p>

    <p class="linejump">
      Rico bought one of those other companies in 2000, Tag Express, improving on its delivery and service to become one of the top hardgood licensees for the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, and many colleges and universities.  As the fourth generation joined the business, the company grew with two more acquisitions in 2009 – Big League Promotions and Tags By Design. In 2013 Rico launched its first brand, SPARO, starting with a line of fashionable sports-licensed watches.
    </p>

    <p class="linejump">
      Poised for continued growth in the years ahead, Rico Industries has kept and will always keep those values it started with – telling the truth, seeing a job through to the end, keeping its promises – close to heart.
    </p>

    <p class="linejump">
      Thank you for your business.

    <p class="linejump">
      Sincerely,
    </p>
